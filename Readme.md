# OpenWarp fman plugin

**Version 0.1.0**

Opens a new [Warp terminal](https://www.warp.dev/)
(either new window or new tab) 
in the current directory pane.
Here, the Warp [URI scheme](https://docs.warp.dev/features/uri-scheme#how-to-use-it)
is used in combination with `subprocess.run` and the `fman` defined path specification.

This extends the functionality of the built-in open terminal command and is separate from it.
Any commands/ideas/extensions are very welcome.

## Key Bindings
* [Ctrl+T]: Open a new Warp window in the current tab
* [Ctrl+Shift+T] Open a new tab in an existing Warp window

Feel free to adjust the KeyBindings to your liking!

## Installation:
Use fmans built in plugin installation tools.
